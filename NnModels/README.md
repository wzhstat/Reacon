# NnModels
This section contains some simple feedforward neural network models with inputs of reactants (512) and product fingerprints (512) and outputs of vectors directed to the target.

## Training 
To train a model, you can run ```train_nnmodel.py'''. Depending on the number of epochs selected, the training time is about 1h. Here are some config you can change: <pr>
